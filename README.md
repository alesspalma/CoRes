# NLP course a.y. 2021/22: Homework #3

Coreference Resolution project that reached 89.86% accuracy score on the [GAP dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/gap-coreference). This was the **top-scoring** homework of the class. I developed it in Pytorch using Transformers and BiLSTMs. This was the second homework of the NLP 2022 course at Sapienza University of Rome.
